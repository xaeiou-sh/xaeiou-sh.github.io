# Cartridge Font Setup

To complete the font setup for the Seance branding:

1. Download the Cartridge font from: https://www.dafont.com/cartridge.font
2. Extract the font files (should be .ttf, .woff, .woff2 formats if available)
3. Place the font files in the `public/fonts/` directory with the following names:
   - `cartridge.ttf`
   - `cartridge.woff2` (optional but recommended)
   - `cartridge.woff` (optional but recommended)

The font is already configured in `app/globals.css` and will automatically apply to the "SEANCE" logo in the navigation.

If you only have a .ttf file, that's fine - the browser will use that format. The other formats are for better browser compatibility and performance.
